![HandPaint](https://github.com/Flazhik/HandPaint/assets/2077991/57f36fbf-1702-4cbc-bb71-3e12e12a86a0)

This mod paints Feedback / Knuckleblaster / Whiplash with 3 colors (the same way it's done for weapons) and allows you to change these colors as you want.

> Colors settings are located at **Options** > **Plugin config** > **HandPaint**

# Installation

1. Download the **BepInEx** release from [here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21). It's
   recommended to choose **BepInEx_x64** release unless you're certain you have a 32-bit system
2. Extract the contents of **BepInEx** archive in your local **ULTRAKILL** folder. If you're not sure where this folder
   is located, find **ULTRAKILL** in your Steam Library > Right mouse click > **Properties** > **Local files** > **Browse**
3. Download the HandPaint archive [here](https://github.com/Flazhik/HandPaint/releases/download/v1.0.0/HandPaint.v1.0.0.zip), then
   extract its contents at **ULTRAKILL/BepInEx/plugins** (create *plugins* folder manually in case it's missing)
4. Download [PluginConfigurator](https://thunderstore.io/package/download/EternalsTeam/PluginConfigurator/1.10.0/), open the archive and move the contents of **plugins** folder to **ULTRAKILL/BepInEx/plugins**.

You can also use [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/Flazhik/HandPaint) for that.

## Settings
In order to change colors, open **Options** > **Plugin config** > **HandPaint**
